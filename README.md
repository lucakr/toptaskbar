GNOME Shell Extension - Top Task Bar

Inspired by the workflow of [Material Shell](https://github.com/material-shell/material-shell). This was intended to be a workspace menu on the top left of the task bar for GNOME Shell. My plan was to combine this with [Pop Shell](https://github.com/pop-os/shell) tiling to match Material Shell's workflow with significantly fewer changes to the DE appearance.

Development stalled because System76 announced they were working on a custom DE for Pop OS and I switched back to Windows in the meantime.
